# Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0.39-30 has been released

<!-- more -->

Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0.39-30 has been released on Monday, December 02, 2024.

Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.0.39-30 is based on Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.39-30. MySQL recently released 8.0.39 to fix a critical bug, so we skipped 8.0.38 for both Percona XtraDB Cluster and Percona Server for MySQL.

This release installs [Percona Telemetry](https://docs.percona.com/percona-xtradb-cluster/8.0/telemetry.html).

This release contains fixes.
