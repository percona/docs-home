# Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15 and 12.19 have been released

<!-- more -->

The next minor releases of [Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL](https://docs.percona.com/postgresql/16/index.html){:target="_blank"} 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15 and 12.19 have been released throughout June 2024.

Try out Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL using the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.percona.com/postgresql/16/installing.html){:target="_blank"}. 

These releases include the following improvements:

* Save time on matching the etcd distributed configuration store version to be compatible with the rest of components for high-availability solution. We have included the `etcd` package in Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL for all supported operating systems enabling you to install all required components from a single place and be assured of their compatibility. Check the [high-availability](https://docs.percona.com/postgresql/16/solutions/high-availability.html){:target="_blank"} documentation.

* To improve the user experience with LLVM modules on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and compatible derivatives, we have included the latest version 16.0.6 of `llvm` packages in Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL. To ensure a smooth upgrade process, the recommended approach is to upgrade to the latest minor version within your current major version before going to the next major version. 

* Packaging changes:

   * Added support for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat.
