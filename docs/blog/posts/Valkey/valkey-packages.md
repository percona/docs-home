<!-- more -->

With the emergence of Valkey as an open source alternative to Redis, Percona has not stood aside and joined the growing community of enthusiasts. We made our contribution by creating Valkey packages for all popular Linux distributions. And prepared the documentation that includes step-by-step installation instructions and the migration guide from Redis to Valkey.

Check out the [Percona Packages for Valkey documentation](https://docs.percona.com/valkey/index.html){:target="_blank"}.
