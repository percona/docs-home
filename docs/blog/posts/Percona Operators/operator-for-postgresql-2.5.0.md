<!-- more -->

[Percona Operator for PostgreSQL](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/) 2.5.0 has been released on Tuesday, October 08, 2024.

Try it out using the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/quickstart.html).

New features and improvements introduced by these release include:

* [Automated storage scaling](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/scaling.html#scale-storage) allows the Operator to detect if the storage usage on the PVC reaches a certain threshold, and trigger the PVC resize
* [Major versions upgrade improvements](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/ReleaseNotes/Kubernetes-Operator-for-PostgreSQL-RN2.5.0.html#major-versions-upgrade-improvements) make it is possible to upgrade from one PostgreSQL major version to another with custom images for the database cluster components (PostgreSQL, pgBouncer, and pgBackRest)
* [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/aks.html) is now officially supported platform, and also [Azure Blob Storage can now be used for backups](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/backups-storage.html#__tabbed_1_2)

[Important changes in the existing functionality](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mongodb/RN/Kubernetes-Operator-for-PSMONGODB-RN1.18.0.html#deprecation-rename-and-removal) ate the following ones:

* With the Operator versions prior to 2.5.0, [autogenerated TLS certificates](../TLS.md#allow-the-operator-to-generate-certificates-automatically) for all database clusters were based on the same generated root CA. Starting from 2.5.0, the Operator creates root CA on a per-cluster basis.
