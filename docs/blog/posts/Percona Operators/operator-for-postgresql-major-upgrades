# Database major versions upgrade in Percona Operator for PostgreSQL

<!-- more -->

Starting from the Percona Operator for PostgreSQL 2.4.0 release, Operator users can automatically upgrade from one PostgreSQL major version to another. Upgrade is triggered by applying the yaml file with the information about the existing and desired major versions.
The feature has **technical preview** status and is not yet recommended for production environments.

Check official documentation for [more details](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-postgresql/2.0/update.md#major-version-upgrade){:target="_blank"}, including ones about tracking the upgrade process and side effects for users with custom extensions.
