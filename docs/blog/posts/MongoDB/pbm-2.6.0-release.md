<!-- more -->

Percona Backup for MongoDB 2.6.0 has been released on September 2, 2024.

This release provides the following features and improvements:

* [Support for multiple storages for backups and restores](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/features/multi-storage.html){:target="_blank"} enables you to define additional remote backup storages and instruct PBM to which storage to save a backup. This ability helps you save on data transfer costs when using cloud storage, as well as enables you to follow closely with the requirements of your organizationâ€™s backup policy.

* [Adjust node priority for point-in-time recovery oplog slicing](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/features/point-in-time-recovery.html#adjust-node-priority-for-oplog-slices){:target="_blank"} and have more control over the process. For example, prioritize geographically closest nodes for oplog slicing and reduce the network latency. 

* [Snapshot-based physical backups](https://docs.percona.com/percona-backup-mongodb/features/snapshots.html){:target="_blank"} are generally available enabling you to use this functionality on production and enjoy all the benefits of faster restores from snapshots with almost immediate access to data.

* Dropped support of MongoDB 4.4. Existing functionality remains compatible with Percona Server for MongoDB 4.4. Further enhancements and bug fixes are no longer tested against this version. 

* Packaging changes:
  
    * Added support for Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat).
    * We no longer provide packages for Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver), Debian 10 and Red Hat Enterprise 7 and derivatives as these operating systems reached End-Of-Life
