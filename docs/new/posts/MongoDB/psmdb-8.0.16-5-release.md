# Percona Server for MongoDB 8.0.16-5 has been released

<!-- more -->

[Percona Server for MongoDB](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/8.0/index.html){:target="_blank"} 8.0.16-5 has been released on December 2, 2025.

Try it out using the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/8.0/install/index.html){:target="_blank"}. 

This release provides the following improvements:

* No vendor lock-in with OpenBao support for data-at-rest encryption. Percona Server for MongoDB is integrated with OpenBao, the open-source fork of HashiCorp Vault. This enables you to offer the same level of security — without the constraints of vendor lock-in. For guidance on configuring OpenBao, check our [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/8.0/openbao.html){:target="_blank"}.
* Percona Server for MongoDB is now officially supported and tested on Rocky Linux 8 and 9. The fully supported status for Rocky Linux gives you confidence to run production workloads on a community‑driven, enterprise‑ready operating system. 
* Sunsetting Pro builds. We no longer release Pro builds of Percona Server for MongoDB. All features that were previously included in Pro Builds are now accessible to everyone in our regular public builds.

    If you require a Pro Build for a specific version, your Percona representative is ready to guide you. Our goal is to ensure a smooth transition and continued success with Percona's open‑source solutions, enhanced with enterprise‑grade capabilities.
