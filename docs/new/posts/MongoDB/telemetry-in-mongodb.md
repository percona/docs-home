# Telemetry in Percona Server for MongoDB

<!-- more -->

We have added Telemetry starting with Percona Server for MongoDB 6.0.16-13 and  7.0.12-7. This way we intend to improve our software as we believe that telemetry helps us identify popular features, detect problems, and plan future improvements.

Currently, telemetry is added only to the Percona packages for both basic and Pro builds and to Docker images.

The data we collect is anonymous, meaning it canâ€™t be traced back to any individual user. Learn what we collect, what we don't collect and why telemetry matters from the [Telemetry and data collection](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/latest/telemetry.html){:target="_blank"} document.
