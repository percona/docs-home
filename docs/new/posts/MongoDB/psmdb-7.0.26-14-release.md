<!-- more -->

[Percona Server for MongoDB](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/7.0/index.html){:target="_blank"} 7.0.26-14 has been released on November 25, 2025.

Try it out using the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/7.0/install/index.html){:target="_blank"}. 

This release provides the following improvements:

* Percona Server for MongoDB is now officially supported and tested on Rocky Linux 8 and 9. The fully supported status for Rocky Linux gives you confidence to run production workloads on a community‑driven, enterprise‑ready operating system. 
* Sunsetting Pro builds. We no longer release Pro builds of Percona Server for MongoDB. All features that were previously included in Pro Builds are now accessible to everyone in our regular public builds.

    If you require a Pro Build for a specific version, your Percona representative is ready to guide you. Our goal is to ensure a smooth transition and continued success with Percona's open‑source solutions, enhanced with enterprise‑grade capabilities.
