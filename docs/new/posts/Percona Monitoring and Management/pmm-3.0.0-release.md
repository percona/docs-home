# Percona Monitoring and Management 3.0.0 has been released

<!-- more -->


## General Availability of PMM 3.0.0

We're excited to announce the General Availability of PMM 3.0.0, a new major version that introduces a complete architectural overhaul of PMM. 

This milestone delivers major security improvements with rootless deployments, encryption of sensitive data, enhanced stability through containerized architecture, and improved user experience with flexible monitoring configurations. 

### Ready to install or migrate to PMM 3?
We provide two installation scripts to help you get started with this new version:

- For new installations, the [Easy-Install script](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/3/quickstart/index.html){:target="_blank"} comes with Watchtower pre-configured, enabling one-step PMM setup with automatic updates.
- For existing PMM 2 users, we provide a dedicated [Upgrade script](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/3/pmm-upgrade/migrating_from_pmm_2.html#step-2-migrate-pmm-2-server-to-pmm-3){:target="_blank"} that safely migrates your installation to PMM 3 and ensures data is backed up before the upgrade.

For detailed information about all changes and new features, see  the full [release notes](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/3/release-notes/3.0.0.html){:target="_blank"}.
