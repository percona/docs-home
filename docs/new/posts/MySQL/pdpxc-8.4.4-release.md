# Percona Distribution for MySQL 8.4.4 using Percona XtraDB Cluster has been released

<!-- more -->

[Percona Distribution for MySQL 8.4.4 using Percona XtraDB Cluster](https://docs.percona.com/percona-distribution-for-mysql/8.4/index.html){:target="_blank"} has been released on Tuesday, April , 2025.

Try it out using the [Installation guide](https://docs.percona.com/percona-distribution-for-mysql/8.4/installing.html){:target="_blank"}.

Percona XtraDB Cluster is based on Percona Server for MySQL and contains all improvements and bug fixes available in the Percona Server for MySQL 8.4.4-4 (2025-03-18) release notes.

### Percona XtraDB Cluster 8.4.4-4

Implements the [Clone plugin for State Snapshot Transfer (SST) Method](https://docs.percona.com/percona-xtradb-cluster/8.4/clone-sst.html). The Clone SST is a modern and efficient method that leverages MySQL's native cloning capabilities to transfer data from a donor node to a Joiner node. It is faster and more resource-efficient compared to traditional methods like xtrabackup or rsync.

### Percona Server for MySQL 8.4.4-4

Improves the [Data masking](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.4/data-masking-overview.html) performance by introducing an internal term cache. The new cache speeds up lookups for `gen_blocklist()` and `gen_dictionary()` functions by storing dictionary data in memory. However, if the dictionary table is modified directly (outside of the proper functions), the cache may become out of sync. To fix this, use the `new masking_dictionaries_flush()` function.

Changes also affect row-based replication: dictionary changes on the source server are replicated, but the term cache on the replica doesnâ€™t update immediately. To address this, a new system setting, `component_masking_functions.dictionaries_flush_interval_seconds()`, can be set to automatically refresh the cache at specified intervals, helping replicas stay in sync.

Find more detailed information in the [Data masking overview](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.4/data-masking-overview.html) and in the [Data masking component functions](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.4/data-masking-function-list.html).

### MySQL 8.4.4

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.4.4 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* Fixed an assertion in debug builds where certain IO buffer serializations caused system hangs. (Bug #37139618)

* Resolved a failure when dropping the primary key and adding a new `AUTO_INCREMENT` column as the primary key in descending order using the `INPLACE` algorithm resulted in failure. (Bug #36658450)

* Fixed incorrect results, including missing rows, in queries that used a descending primary key with the `index_merge` optimization. (Bug #106207, Bug #33767814)

* Addressed a replication channel issue where MySQL failed to stop the channel properly when large transactions were being processed, and `STOP REPLICA` was requested. This issue also prevented graceful server shutdown, requiring process termination or system restart. (Bug #115966, Bug #37008345)
