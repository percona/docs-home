# Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona Server for MySQL 0.12.0 has been released

<!-- more -->

[Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona Server for MySQL](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mysql/ps/index.html){:target="_blank"} 0.12.0 has been released on September 23, 2025.

Version 0.12.0 of the Percona Operator for MySQL is still **a tech preview release**, and it is **not recommended for production environments**. You can try it out using the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mysql/ps/quickstart.html){:target="_blank"}.

New features and improvements introduced by this release include:

* [Data-at-rest encryption for MySQL 8.4](Quickstart guide](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mysql/ps/encryption-setup.html){:target="_blank"} makes Percona Server for MySQL 8.4 be fully supported by the Operator. This improvement empowers you to take full advantage of Percona Server for MySQL 8.4â€™s features while benefiting from seamless, automated lifecycle management provided by the Operator. Percona Server for MySQL 8.4 is now the default version for deploying a database cluster.

* Ensure cluster availability with PodDisruptionBudgets. You can configure a PodDisruptionBudget for MySQL, HAProxy, MySQL Router, and Orchestrator Pods, thus ensuring your cluster remains available during voluntary disruptions, such as deleting a deployment or draining a node for maintenance.

* Gain more control over backup and restore operations with the ability to configure `xtrabackup`, `xbstream`, and `xbcloud` binaries. You can apply the configuration globally or for a specific backup / restore job. Individual settings override the global ones. Learn more about fine- tuning backups and restores and how the settings are applied in our [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mysql/ps/backups-fine-tune.html){:target="_blank"}  

* Monitor PMM Client health and status with probes - a Kubernetes diagnostics mechanism. Use the `spec.pmm.readinessProbes.*` and `spec.pmm.livenessProbes.*` Custom Resource options to fine-tune Readiness and Liveness probes for PMM Client.

* Tailor your backup strategy with the ability to define a backup source Pod. For asynchronous replication clusters, the Operator must know the cluster topology to run a backup. For this, either enable the Orchestrator in your deployment. Or specify the `sourcePod` value, if your cluster has more than one MySQL Pods. 

* Deprecation, rename and removal

    * The `.spec.initImage` field has been replaced by the `.spec.initContainer` subsection, which follows Kubernetes best practices for defining containers that run before the main containers in a Pod. The `initContainer` feature is helpful for setup tasks such as:

       - Initializing data
       - Waiting for services to become available
       - Setting permissions
       - Pulling secrets or configuration files

* The default cluster name has been changed to `ps-cluster1` to prevent possible conflicts if you have custom resources of both Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona Server for MySQL and Percona XtraDB Cluster in the same namespace.

* The API version in CRDs is changed from `v1alpha` to `v1`. To upgrade to version 0.12.0, you must manually delete the CRDs, apply new ones and recreate the cluster. To keep the data, do the following:

    * check that the `percona.com/delete-mysql-pvc` finalizer is not enabled in `deploy/cr.yaml`
    * don't delete PVCs manually
    * Recreate the cluster with the same name. The Operator then automatically reuses the same PVCs.
