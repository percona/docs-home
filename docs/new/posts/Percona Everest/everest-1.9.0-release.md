Here's a brief overview of what's been added in Percona Everest 1.9.0:

[Load balancer configuration in Percona Everest](https://docs.percona.com/everest/release-notes/Percona-Everest-1.9.0-%282025-09-23%29.html#load-balancer-configuration-in-percona-everest){:target="_blank"} 

Provisioning external access to Kubernetes clusters can be challenging, since cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure each have their own annotations and configurations for LoadBalancers. As a result, users often have to manually adjust settings for each environment, leading to a lack of a unified approach.

Percona Everest simplifies the process by enabling administrators to define reusable LoadBalancer configurations. This includes cloud provider-specific settings that can be applied consistently across clusters, ensuring:

- ‚úÖ Consistency across cloud and on-prem environments

- üîÑ Reduced manual effort when provisioning external access

- üåç Flexibility to support multiple cloud providers with a unified approach
