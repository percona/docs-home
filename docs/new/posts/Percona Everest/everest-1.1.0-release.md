[Percona Everest](https://docs.percona.com/everest/index.html){:target="_blank"} 1.1.0 has been released on Thursday, August 12, 2024. 

Give Percona Everest a go by following our [Quickstart guide](https://docs.percona.com/everest/quickstart-guide/quick-install.html){:target="_blank"}.

Here's a brief overview of what's been added in Percona Everest 1.1.0:

- [Backups and restores enhancements](https://docs.percona.com/everest/release-notes/Percona-Everest-1.1.0-%282024-08-12%29.html#enhancements-for-postgresql-disaster-recovery){:target="_blank"}: We have enhanced the reliability of our backups and restores by implementing limits on how we manage backup storage. This proactive strategy ensures that we can prevent potential issues from arising in edge-case scenarios.

- [API rate limiter](https://docs.percona.com/everest/use/API_rate_limit.html){:target="_blank"}: We have implemented a rate limiter to manage the number of API requests you can make within a specific time frame. If you exceed this limit, you will receive an error message on the login page.
